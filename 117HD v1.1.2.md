# Intro
Greetings from the 117hd team! Today's update is focused on bug fixing, polish and technology updates.

If you have any bugs to report or want to help out with feedback/development then please drop by the discord server at https://discord.gg/U4p6ChjgSE!

# Engine
* Lots of code cleanup

* Updated OpenGL backend to use RLAWT/LWJGL instead of JOGL. This can give large performance uplifts for Mac users and allows the plugin to run on some older GPU's, usually with support below OpenGL 4.6 but >=4.0.
* Fixed kernel loading for mac
* Updated Gradle version

# General Improvements
* Fixed winter theme toggle bug and moved to misc settings

* Fixed incorrect water tiles in GOTR with low detail mode turned on
* Fixed desert treasure pyramid tile texture to be sand bricks again instead of snow
* Fixed true blood altar to be surrounded by liquid blood instead of red dirt
* Improved instant environment transition logic so that it activates more appropriately
* Made switching between different plugins based on Runelite's GPU plugin much more reliable (GPU, 117HD, Region-locked GPU etc)
* Fixed Gu'tanoth cave to have swamp water instead of green dirt
* Fixed bug in sky color update function which could cause the sky to be the wrong color
* Fixed hard crash when loading certain rare light sources, improved handling of certain lights/npcs/objects
* Updated interaction with Entity Hider to correctly show your own pet and its lighting, consistent with the base game and GPU plugin
* Added Ancient Wyverns, Kovac, Youngllef and the Magic Carpets to the list of baked shadows/lights which can be hidden
* Updated water color controls to allow for greater dev configuration

# Environments
* Changed water in cave environments to be teal-blue instead of brown (Keldagrim, MLM etcetc)
